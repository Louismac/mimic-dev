But there are many other techniques used to allow computers to do seemingly smart things. One of these is called a genetic algorithm. With genetic algorithms, we can actually breed things inside a computer, just like we might breed new varieties of crops or animals. The idea is to work with a small population of things (in this case, sounds) which we are going breed and mutate until we are satisfied with the results.\\\\n\\\"],[10],[0,\\\"\\\\n\\\"],[7,\\\"p\\\"],[11,\\\"class\\\",\\\"tutorial-text\\\"],[9],[0,\\\"\\\\nIn this example, we are going to use a genetic algorithm to breed virtual modular synthesizer patches.
